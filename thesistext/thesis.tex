\begin{preface}
An intensive year of programming, writing and reviewing has preceded the submission of this thesis text. I would like to take this opportunity to present my gratitude to those who have made this possible. 

First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Bart Preneel and Prof. Vincent Rijmen for making this research possible.

Second of all, I would like to thank my mentor Filipe Beato for the many intensive feedback sessions. I am truly inspired by his enthusiasm and patience while answering all my questions. I can imagine the frustration Filipe must have gone through while reading thesis drafts that lacked every sign of academic English. Thereby neglecting, the even larger frustration Filipe must have felt when I simply did not understand his remarks on my academic English from the beginning.

I would also like to acknowledge my assessors, Prof. Claudia Diaz and Prof. Frank Piessens for giving their insights and taking the time to read this text.

I cannot forget to mention Sofie for being around and supporting me. No one in my environment has inspired and motivated me more than Sofie.

Special gratitude goes to all my friends at Lerkeveld and VTK for distracting me during my leisure time. I am sorry for all the times I shared these little frustrations that come with writing a thesis text.

Finally, special thanks goes to my parents who have always believed in me during my five year study at KU Leuven. Without their financial and emotional support I would not have pursued my dream to become an engineer.

\begin{abstract}
  Nowadays Online Social Networks (OSNs) constitute an important and useful communication channel. At the same time, coarse-grained privacy preferences protect the shared information insufficiently. Cryptographic techniques can provide interesting mechanism to protect privacy of users in OSNs. However, this approach faces several issues, such as, OSN provider acceptance, user adoption, key management and usability. We suggest a practical solution that uses Identity Based Encryption (IBE) to simplify key management and enforce confidentiality of data in OSNs. Moreover, we devise an outsider anonymous broadcast IBE scheme to disseminate information among multiple users, even if they are not using the system. Finally, we demonstrate the viability and tolerable overhead of our solution via an open-source prototype.
