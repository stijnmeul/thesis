\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}
The newest internet trend at the dawn of the 21st century certainly is the Online Social Network (OSN). Words like tweeting, sharing, liking, trending and tagging have found common acceptance in the vocabulary of today's internet savvy users while services like Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter have become part of everyday life. 

The far reaching influence of today's most popular OSNs is best illustrated with the help of some statistics. In May 2013, 72\% of all internet users were active on a social network~\cite{site:Jones13}. At the time of writing, Facebook has 1.23 Billion monthly active users which corresponds to 17\% of the global population~\cite{site:Bullas14,site:worldometers}. Furthermore, the average Facebook user spends 15 hours and 33 minutes online per month~\cite{site:StatisticBrain}. These numbers show that social networks no longer represent the latest craze of an internet bubble but are conversely deeply rooted in our daily habits.
