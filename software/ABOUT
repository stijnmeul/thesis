Scramble! prototype ...

DESCRIPTION:

    Scramble! provides a mechanisms for users to enforce access control over their one data. Its main target is to protect users to share sensitive information with Social Network Sites providers. Allows the creation of a web of friends and by means of encryption to enforce access rights. Scramble allows users to create groups of friends and transparent decryption.

    Scramble! uses the OpenPGP standard as the encryption mechanism, and therefore builds further on the existing PKI infrastructure and key management model, allowing also "broadcast" encryption for multiple recipients. GnuPG also allows to perform anonymous recipient encryption by omitting the public key IDs from the encrypted blob, but is still vulnerable for active attacks. Apart from storing large amounts of encrypted data in a SNS, it is also possible to only list "tiny url" snippets, that refer to the encrypted data into a third server. In this way the problem of the large ciphertext size that currently grows linear in the number of users that are granted access is minimised, as well as the visual contamination of the SNS platform.
