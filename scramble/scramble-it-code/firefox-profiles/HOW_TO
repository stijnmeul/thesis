Create two Firefox profiles.

For each of them, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced tab -> Encryption tab -> View Certificates -> Import -> select the file x509.cacert -> tick the "Trust this CA to identify software developers" checkbox -> OK

Copy the scrambleData in your two profiles and you will be able to use the keys and settings as they are (no need to generate key and import contacts).

Install scramble-1-12-signed.xpi

Have fun!
