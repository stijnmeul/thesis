  abstract = {In 2010, Fan et al. proposed an efficient anonymous multi-receiver
	identity-based encryption scheme. This scheme allows a sender to
	send an encrypted message to a set of designated receivers while
	preserving receiver anonymity. The scheme is highly efficient for
	each receiver as it requires only two pairing operations. However,
	we found that the scheme failed to protect receiver anonymity and
	the security notation for receiver anonymity captures only semantics
	in the case of a single receiver, but does not for multiple recipients.
	In this paper, we present the weaknesses and propose an improved
	scheme. The improved scheme enhances both security and computational
	performance.},
