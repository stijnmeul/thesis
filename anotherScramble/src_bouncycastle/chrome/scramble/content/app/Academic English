Academic English 


The main objective of attending the Academic English course was to improve the effectiveness of clearly describe research ideas and contributions in scientific articles. During the course of each lesson I have identified the principal issues leading to overcomplicated writing. Although mainly improved by short and more direct sentences, also the use of articles and grammatical tricks.
